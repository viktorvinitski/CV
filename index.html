            I was born and live in Minsk. Iâ€™m studying Web development and
            looking for my first job as a frontend-developer. I haven't
            experience in commercial development, but I have a great desire to
            learn and develop in the field of web development. Ready to work
            hard to learn new things. I am considering both employment and the
            possibility of an internship with further employment. Have an
            experience in team-development of projects on React

            feel myself as a real developer, because there is the best way to
            become developer is stydying with people, who are already working in
            this company. I think, that solving of tasks from real projects is
